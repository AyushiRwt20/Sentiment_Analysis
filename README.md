# Sentiment_Analysis
# Overview
This project is a sentiment analysis system that leverages machine learning techniques to classify the sentiment of tweets as positive or negative. It provides an end-to-end solution for sentiment analysis, from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and prediction for new inputs.

#### Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing tweet datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data distribution and visualizing word clouds.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training and evaluating a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis.
- **Prediction Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for analyzing the sentiment of new comments.
- **Performance Visualization**: Visualizing the performance of the trained model.
#### Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Manipulation and Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **CountVectorizer**: For converting text data into numerical data (bag-of-words model).
- **MultinomialNB**: Naive Bayes classifier for text classification.
- **Text Processing**: Regular Expressions (re)
